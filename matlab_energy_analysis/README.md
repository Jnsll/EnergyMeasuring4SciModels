## Entry Points

Execute `entryPoints.m`. All possible entrypoint-.m-files will get listed in each project 
in a `entrypoints.csv` file in the project's root directory.

If you want to use the entryPoints-script to determine entry points in your subfolder myDirectory, start 
the script like this: `entryPoints.m(<myDirectory>)`.
