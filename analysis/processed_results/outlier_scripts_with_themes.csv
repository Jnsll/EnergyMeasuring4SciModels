Instead, it is more efficient to directly store the values in the cache without using intermediate variables. This reduces memory usage and improves energy efficiency., In the original code, the `ver` function is called with the argument `env`, which is a string variable. However, since `env` is already stored in the cache, it is more efficient to call `ver` with the cached value `cache.env` instead of the variable `env`. This reduces the number of operations and improves energy efficiency., The original code uses the `persistent` keyword to declare the `cache` variable, which is good for energy efficiency because it avoids the overhead of creating a new variable every time the function is called. However, it is important to note that the `persistent` keyword should be used with caution, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly.

Instead, it is more efficient to directly store the values in the cache without using intermediate variables. This reduces memory usage and improves energy efficiency., In the original code, the `ver` function is called with the argument `env`, which is a string variable. However, since `env` is already stored in the cache, it is more efficient to call `ver` with the cached value `cache.env` instead of the variable `env`. This reduces the number of operations and improves energy efficiency., The original code uses the `persistent` keyword to declare the `cache` variable, which is good for energy efficiency because it avoids the overhead of creating a new variable every time the function is called. However, it is important to note that the `persistent` keyword should be used with caution, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly. In this case, it is used appropriately to store the environment and version string between function calls.";"nan, nan, nan"

Therefore, I removed the change of directory to save energy and improve efficiency., The original code then changes the current directory back to `cur_dir` at the end of the script. Since we no longer change the current directory, this line is also unnecessary and has been removed., The original code uses the `pwd` function to get the current directory and save it in `cur_dir`.

Instead, it is more efficient to directly store the values in the cache without using intermediate variables. This reduces memory usage and improves energy efficiency., In the original code, the `ver` function is called with the argument `env`, which is a string variable. However, since `env` is already stored in the cache, it is more efficient to call `ver` with the cached value `cache.env` instead of the variable `env`. This reduces the number of operations and improves energy efficiency., The original code uses the `persistent` keyword to declare the `cache` variable, which is good for energy efficiency because it avoids the overhead of creating a new variable every time the function is called. However, it is important to note that the `persistent` keyword should be used with caution, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly.

This change significantly improves the code's performance by eliminating the loop and taking advantage of Matlab's built-in vectorization capabilities., The new code generates the required number of random points in a single function call, which is more energy-efficient than generating them one by one in a loop., The overall optimized code is more readable and easier to maintain due to the reduction in the number of variables and the removal of the for loop.";"nan, Vectorization, nan, nan"

Instead of using `repmat`, we can use the `bsxfun` function with the `@minus` function handle to perform the same operation more efficiently. This is because `bsxfun` applies the element-wise operation (`@minus` in this case) between arrays with singleton expansion enabled, which eliminates the need to explicitly replicate the mean vector., The rest of the code remains unchanged as the computation of the matrix `C` and its multiplication with `x` to obtain `xc2` are already optimized.

This reduces memory usage and improves energy efficiency., In the original code, the `ver` function is called with the argument `env`, which is a string variable. However, since `env` is already stored in the cache, it is more efficient to call `ver` with the cached value `cache.env` instead of the variable `env`. This reduces the number of operations and improves energy efficiency., The original code uses the `persistent` keyword to declare the `cache` variable, which is good for energy efficiency because it avoids the overhead of creating a new variable every time the function is called.

Instead, it is more efficient to directly store the values in the cache without using intermediate variables. This reduces memory usage and improves energy efficiency., In the original code, the `ver` function is called with the argument `env`, which is a string variable. However, since `env` is already stored in the cache, it is more efficient to call `ver` with the cached value `cache.env` instead of the variable `env`. This reduces the number of operations and improves energy efficiency., The original code uses the `persistent` keyword to declare the `cache` variable, which is good for energy efficiency because it avoids the overhead of creating a new variable every time the function is called. However, it is important to note that the `persistent` keyword should be used with caution, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly. In this case, it is used appropriately to store the environment and version string between function calls.";"nan, nan, nan"

This reduces the number of iterations over the data and improves code readability., Replaced the use of `find` with logical indexing to improve performance and readability., Removed the `web browser` lines, as they are not relevant to the code execution and do not provide any useful information., Added comments to improve code readability and maintainability., Removed the `clear all; clc;` lines, as they are not necessary for the code to execute properly., Replaced the use of multiple `for` loops with a single loop to calculate the distances between samples and centroids. This reduces the number of iterations over the data and improves code readability., Replaced the use of `min` function with the `min` function with two output arguments to get the index of the minimum value in a vector. This improves code readability and performance., Replaced the use of `ecnt1`-`ecnt5` and `tc1`-`tc5` with `ecnt` and `T2` respectively to simplify the code and improve readability., Replaced the use of `repmat` function with a simpler and more efficient way to generate `T2` using `reshape` and `ones` functions.";"nan, Improved Code Readability & Maintainability, Improved Code Readability & Maintainability, nan, Improved Code Readability & Maintainability, nan, Improved Code Readability & Maintainability, Improved Code Readability & Maintainability, Improved Code Readability & Maintainability, nan"
