observations:
- often the important stuff is not happening in the scripts themselves but rather in functions called by the scripts.
- many scripts seem to be a work in progress. Scientists work interactively with the scripts,
  comment out versions of code lines that they don't want to consider for the moment,
  omit semicolons because they want to investigate calculation result in the command window,
  use clear and clc to start the script (which would be unnecessary if it was a function),
  using tic and toc to time execution time
- script NaveGo->optimizer.m only runs through because error is caught inside script (file imu_structure doesn't work as a function).
  Data files to load data from are missing. No optimization possible without any further information.
- script GenerateTrainingPatches doesn't calculate anything with folder = "Train400" (original folder definition to load files from)
- script chapter22_bp appears twice - file is copied, no difference in code
- script vl_setupnn is doing nothing but adding directories to the Matlab path (some of them non-existent)
- scripts that create a directory might be slower the first time they are run than in following runs
